# Projects
Project to allow users to view working files

 General working portfolio for all my outstanding development projects which include:
 
 Unity Engine - Mostly Unity 2D
 Web Development - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and NodeJS
 General Purpose Programming Languages - Java
 
 My objective for the github profile is to hopefully attempt to add to, update, develop to my existing programming languages and projects as well as learn from others. The plan is to add to my GitHub page within 3 week periods and to keep the page active, although other commitments might delay some uploads but hopefully not. If for whatever reason you are browsing my GitHub and notice anything that could be improved or done differently please feel free to make changes to projects.
