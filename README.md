# Projects
An old discontiued set of projects that was started.

 It was a general working portfolio for all my outstanding development projects which included:
 
 Unity Engine - Mostly Unity 2D
 Web Development - HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and NodeJS
 General Purpose Programming Languages - Java
 
 My objective for the GitHub profile was to hopefully attempt to add to, update, develop any existing projects further as well as gain exposure to others languages. The plan was to add to my GitHub page within 3 week periods and to keep the page active, although other commitments and obligations had taken priority. Work is currently on for <b> potential employers  </b>to see the progress from previous projects that were started prior to my most recent business website. (Only available upon request or upload to employment website)
